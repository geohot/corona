# Masks Dont Really Work

(Oi this gonna piss @Burd*ck off again)

**not only will it be masks that dont really work that I will prove in this, I will also prove even respirators do not work. **

**Framework: **

- One has to agree that not all of us are able to buy the best of masks and use them therefore this model will be built upon n96, cloth, and surgical. respirators are the normal ones too. 

Some Declarations: 

1. Do not rebut me. Me myself is enough to do that.
2. If you must, do not rebut with the China example, for I am a Chinese and I know it is forced lockdown - a national intrusion which hurts the liberty of yours - that helped.

### Foreword

Firstly, there are already extensive randomized controlled trial [(RCT, link is the wikipedia definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) studies, like GeoHot mentioned in his video (dont remember and am too lazy to find, just the time when he said he forgot where the study is, pt8 or pt9) and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators **do not** work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles. 

The one I will use is this: [Human coronavirus data from four clinical trials of masks and respirators](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30399-4/fulltext), Published in June 01, 2020.

The present paper about how masks help and such illustrates the degree to which governments, the mainstream media, and institutional propagandists can decide to operate in a science vacuum, or select only incomplete science that serves their interests, an unprecedented flood of fake news in medical and political history. Indeed, more than the ['fake news' of Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqpzk-qGxMU&list=PLKPqJcw8D5OH0qQCEfjAXW7zDiGbYiDmC&index=10&t=0s).

### Quotes

OK, ballocking finished, lets get to the interesting part: 

**Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., N95, Surgical) does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:**

- **Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009)** 'Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,' *American Journal of Infection Control*, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 – 419. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002. *Well, this is ages ago, but*

  'N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.'

- **Smith, J.D. et al. (2016)** 'Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,' *CMAJ* Mar 2016 https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567

  'We identified six clinical studies … . In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism.'

- **Offeddu, V. et al. (2017)** 'Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,' *Clinical Infectious Diseases*, Volume 65, Issue 11, 1 December 2017, Pages 1934–1942, https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747

  'Self-reported assessment of clinical outcomes was prone to bias. Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection (VRI) was not statistically significant'; as per Fig. 2c therein:

- **Long, Y. et al. (2020)** 'Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis,'  *J Evid Based Med.* 2020; 1- 9. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jebm.12381

  'A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.'

- **Amy Orciari Herman et al. (2020)** 'COVID-19 Update: Ineffective Surgical Masks / WHO Guidance on Masks / More Evidence on Convalescent Plasma' https://www.jwatch.org/fw116526/2020/04/07/covid-19-update-ineffective-surgical-masks-who-guidance

  'Surgical and cotton face masks appear ineffective for blocking SARS-CoV-2 when COVID-19 patients cough, according to a small study in the *Annals of Internal Medicine*.'

  *(This one... The Annals of Internal Medicine link dont work therefore I cannot get the original text... dunno why... It worked not long a time ago though)*

- I wont use 'et al.' this time because this is just too much & I dont know who did the most work: **Seongman Bae, MD, Min-Chul Kim, MD, Ji Yeun Kim, PhD, Hye-Hee Cha, BS, Joon Seo Lim, PhD, Jiwon Jung, MD, Min-Jae Kim, MD, Dong Kyu Oh, MD, Mi-Kyung Lee, MD, Seong-Ho Choi, MD, Minki Sung, PhD, Sang-Bum Hong, MD, Jin-Won Chung, MD, Sung-Han Kim, MD** 'Effectiveness of Surgical and Cotton Masks in Blocking SARS–CoV-2: A Controlled Comparison in 4 Patients' 

  'In conclusion, both surgical and cotton masks seem to be ineffective in preventing the dissemination of SARS–CoV-2 from the coughs of patients with COVID-19 to the environment and external mask surface.'

This is somewhat enough isn't it... One of the interesting things I found doing these research is that many websites, even sometimes the papers writing about the ineffectiveness of masks, are deleted... such as the last one (the long list of names one), a very formal paper written with all those data and experiment logs, is declared as 'retracted'. Political Pressure? I dont know.

### Conclusion Regarding That Masks Do Not Work

No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. **There are no exceptions. At all.**

Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public, on the words of **Denis G. Rancourt, PhD**.

Anyway, now in

### Conclusion of ALL

For the fact that all these medical research are here, it is difficult to understand (you get me) why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks.
